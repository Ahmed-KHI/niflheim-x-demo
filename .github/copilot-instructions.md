# Niflheim-X Demo Project Instructions

## Project Overview
This is a Flask-based web application that demonstrates the capabilities of the niflheim-x framework - a lightweight AI agent orchestration framework. The demo showcases:

- ✅ Agent creation with Gemini API integration
- ✅ Tool integration examples  
- ✅ Memory systems demonstration
- ✅ Multi-agent orchestration
- ✅ Real-time streaming capabilities
- ✅ Production-ready deployment on Vercel

## Project Structure
- `app.py` - Main Flask application with API endpoints
- `templates/` - HTML templates for the web interface
- `static/` - CSS, JavaScript, and static assets
- `niflheim_adapters/` - Custom Gemini API adapter
- `examples/` - Demo scenarios and use cases
- `vercel.json` - Vercel deployment configuration
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

## Development Guidelines
- Focus on showcasing niflheim-x's lightweight and fast performance
- Demonstrate the framework's composable architecture
- Highlight the minimal dependency footprint
- Show real-world use cases with practical examples
- Ensure all examples work with Gemini API key only

## Deployment
Optimized for Vercel serverless deployment with proper configuration for Python runtime.
